1. Add a new token class HttpAuthenticationToken

It has a hashmap to store parameters/values from the http request. 

2. Use the new token class in the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter class which will store all parameter/value pairs in the 
httpservletrequest.

3. The HttpAuthenticationToken class can be used in your customized authetication provider for your usage.

4. in the command line type: ./gradlew install, it will install the new build 3.2.5release in your local maven repository.

5. to force gradle to pick up the customized spring-security libs, put following in your spring boot build.gradle file:

configurations.all {
    // check for updates every build
    resolutionStrategy.cacheChangingModulesFor 0, 'seconds'
}

dependencies {
    compile group: "org.springframework.security", name: "spring-security-web", version: "3.2.5.RELEASE", changing: true
}


It is a hack. But it gets the job done.
Another way to do it is following the link below. The author proposes a different approach, which I think is awesome.
